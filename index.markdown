## Research interests
I identify and exploit sparse structures in complex, interacting, multi-physics, uncertain, and/or random systems. 
I focus on two types of sparse structures: _sparse graphs_ and _sparse dynamics_, especially in scenarios with 
nonlinear models and non-Gaussian data. I also work on a variety of topics within the fields of calibration, validation, and uncertainty quantification, a broad area that combines elements from science, engineering, mathematics, and computing. 
Applications I have worked on include combustion, epidemiology, climate, satellites and reentry vehicles, and space weather.
