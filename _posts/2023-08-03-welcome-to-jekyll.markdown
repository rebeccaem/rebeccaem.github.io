[comment]: <> You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

[comment]: <> Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

[comment]: <> `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

[comment]: <> Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

[comment]: <> Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

[comment]: <> {% highlight ruby %}
[comment]: <> def print_hi(name)
[comment]: <>   puts "Hi, #{name}"
[comment]: <> end
[comment]: <> print_hi('Tom')
[comment]: <> #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
[comment]: <> {% endhighlight %}
